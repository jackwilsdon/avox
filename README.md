# Avox for Bukkit
This plugin prevents players from interacting with the world if they have the
correct permission.

## How to use
Simply install the plugin and add the permission `avox.is-avox` to a player
using your preferred permission manager and the player will be unable to
interact with the world. Removing the permission will restore this ability.

The plugin does not provide any commands or additional functionality at this
time.

## Avox?
> [An Avox is a person who has been punished for being a rebel against the
> Capitol; a traitor or a deserter. Avoxes have had their tongues cut out,
> rendering them mute.](http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/Avox)

The name of the plugin is a bit misleading, as it does not prevent players
from talking, but instead prevents them from interacting with the world.

The plugin's functionality may be expanded in the future to also prevent
players from talking.
